RefreshRateTester
====================

This is a slightly modified version of shurcooL's RefreshRateMultitool.
This program displays images in sync with your monitor's refresh rate so you can test for frameskipping and artifacts.

Usage: Run RefreshRateTester.exe

This tool is more performant and consistent than browser-based tests.
